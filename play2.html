<h5 class ="name JAC">JAC.</h5><p class ="speech">I was speaking of a sucking pig that your steward has just sent
me; and I want to have it dressed for you after my own fancy.</p>

something else to this gentleman.</p>

<h5 class ="name OFF">OFF.</h5><p class ="speech"> (_to_ JACQUES). Don't get frightened. I am not a man to cause any
scandal, and matters will be carried on by gentle means.</p>
